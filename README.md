# hello-world
my first repository

Hi Everyone,

Look here. I'm now learning python. 
As a Master postgraduate student, I'm majoring in geographical information system (GIS). 
In fact, my main work is remote-sensing image processing in ecological aspects, at present.
In addition, I am intrested in computers and codes.
